bower-highcharts
================

Please stop using this repository, I recommend instead using the 'highcharts.com' package as that is maintained by the highcharts team. Mine was added before there was an official package.

Bower's unregistering process is pretty terrible, otherwise I would have already removed this package. There is an outstanding request to remove it here https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120#ref-issue-19351939.
